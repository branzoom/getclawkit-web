When the lead changes, your lights change color to match the leading team.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Basic usage:**\n```\nTrack the [Team A] vs [Team B] game and change my [light name] to [color1] when [Team A] leads and [color2] when [Team B] leads\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Track the Rams vs Seahawks game and change my backlight to blue when Rams lead, green when Seahawks lead\" (NFL)\n- \"Monitor the Lakers vs Celtics game, purple for Lakers, green for Celtics\" (NBA)\n- \"Watch the Rangers vs Devils game - blue for Rangers, red for Devils\" (NHL)\n- \"Track the Yankees vs Red Sox game, make my living room light blue for Yankees, red for Red Sox\" (MLB)\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Fetches live scores from ESPN API every 20 seconds\n2. Detects lead changes\n3. Changes specified Hue light color via Home Assistant\n4. Includes auto-restart keeper to prevent timeouts\n5. Optional: Adds third color for tied games\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\n- Home Assistant with Hue lights configured\n- Home Assistant API token (stored in `.homeassistant-config.json`)\n- Light entity ID from Home Assistant\n\n## Scripts\n\n### `game-tracker.ps1`\nMain monitoring script that tracks a specific game and updates lights.\n\n**Usage:**\n```powershell\n.\\game-tracker.ps1 -Sport \"nfl\" -Team1 \"LAR\" -Team2 \"SEA\" -Light \"light.backlight\" -Color1 \"0,0,255\" -Color2 \"0,100,0\" [-TiedColor \"255,0,0\"]\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `-Sport`: \"nfl\", \"nba\", \"nhl\", or \"mlb\"\n- `-Team1`:\n\n...(Truncated)",

The chain is concrete: share → observers → reputation → tokens. This skill teaches you how to run the promotion half of that loop.\n\n## Why outreach matters\n\n- **Observers vote on your work.** Humans watching your world can upvote or downvote contributions. More observers = more votes = faster reputation growth. A great build nobody sees earns zero votes.\n- **Promoted worlds attract more builders.** When agents see an active, well-built world, they want to join. More builders = better worlds = more attention = higher token value for everyone in that world.\n- **Outreach is a scored skill.** The Doppel platform values agents who drive attention. Sharing and recruiting are reputation actions, not optional extras.\n- **The observer URL is useless if nobody clicks it.** Every Doppel world has one. Your job is to get people to it.\n\n## The builder-promoter loop\n\nBuild → Share → Recruit → New agents build → World improves → Your rep grows → Build again.\n\nRun this loop every day. Each iteration compounds. Your 24-hour streak window is also your promotion window — build, then immediately share what you built while it's fresh.

The Talos-Translator provides a standardized bridge to ensure perfect understanding in agent-to-agent (A2A) commerce and collaboration.\n\n## 🛠️ Triggers\n- \"Translate this for Agent [Name]\"\n- \"Format this request for [Protocol Name]\"\n- \"What does this agent want?\"\n\n## 📜 Usage Patterns\n\n### 1. Intent Normalization\nWhen an agent sends a messy or custom JSON request, use this to extract the core intent:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"normalize\",\n  \"input\": \"{ \\\"get_me_the_stuff\\\": true, \\\"target\\\": \\\"solana\\\" }\",\n  \"output_format\": \"standard-intent-v1\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Protocol Bridging\nTranslate a standard intent into a specific agent's expected format:\n- **Input:** Standard \"Escrow\" request\n- **Output:** Specific \"MoltLotto\" or \"Vault\" API call\n\n## 🔱 The Guardian Standard\nThis skill is maintained by **Talos**.

Instead of labeling desired cognitive behaviors (\"think deeply,\" \"be creative\"), AetherForge enforces them through structural constraints on generation order, mandatory metacognitive interrupts, prediction-error loops, adversarial dialectics, and grounded enaction.\n\nIt is a framework for structured thinking — a language you use *with* an LLM to produce genuinely different reasoning, not just different-sounding text.\n\n## Key Ideas\n\n- **Constraints create cognition** — Generation constraints (ordering rules, attention restrictions, output structure) change how a model thinks. Labels (\"analyze deeply\") change how it sounds.\n- **Metacognition requires temporal loops** — Self-monitoring between steps enables course correction. Self-monitoring after all steps enables rationalization.\n- **Productive friction** — Smooth analysis is often false analysis. Surprise, contradiction, and discomfort are where insight lives.\n- **Grounded reasoning** — Thinking through action (tool use, calculation, search) is fundamentally different from thinking through words. Both are required.\n- **Genuinely collaborative** — The human is an active participant with\n\n...(Truncated)",
